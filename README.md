## What is This
When I was in high school, I was a National Honor Society (NHS) officer and I decided to improve upon the organization by creating an application to digitize the logging of community service hours by NHS members. 

It is a pretty simple CRUD app built with the MEAN stack, deployed to Heroku. It includes the following features:
- Authentication
- A member can log and track their community service events and hours
- Admins can add "Upcoming Events" that everyone is seen
- Autocomplete an event when logging a new community service event
- Admin control dashboard with password 
- Fully responsive design
